# 🚤 Venice Boat Classification using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify different types of boats found in Venice. Utilizing **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, the model processes image data to identify distinct boat categories, aiding in automated maritime traffic monitoring.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, ImageDataGenerator
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib
* **Platform:** Google Colab

## 📊 Key Results
* **Model Architecture:** Custom CNN with Sequential layers.
* **Validation Accuracy:** ~68% (0.68)
* **Key Features:**
    * Implemented data augmentation to improve model generalization.
    * Utilized categorical cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.
    * Visualized training loss and accuracy curves to monitor overfitting.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Click the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the notebook file.
2.  Upload your dataset to the runtime or mount Google Drive.
3.  Run all cells to train the model or load the saved weights.
